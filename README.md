Networking & Security Interview Questions
Beginner-Level (1-20) Questions
1. What is a network?
A network is a group of interconnected devices that communicate to share resources and information. It can be wired or wireless.

2. What is an IP address?
An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a unique numerical identifier assigned to each device on a network to facilitate communication.

3. What is the difference between IPv4 and IPv6?

29. What is OSI Model and its layers?
The OSI model has 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application.

30. What is a WAF (Web Application Firewall)?
A WAF protects web applications by filtering and blocking malicious HTTP traffic.

31. What is a honeypot in cybersecurity?
A honeypot is a security system designed to detect and study cyberattacks by mimicking real systems.

32. What is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)?
BGP is a routing protocol used for exchanging routing information between networks on the internet.

33. What is DDoS, and how can it be mitigated?
A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack overwhelms a system. It can be mitigated using rate limiting, firewalls, and cloud-based protection.

34. What is the CIA Triad in security?
The CIA Triad stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability, which are fundamental security principles.

35. What is SSO (Single Sign-On)?
SSO allows users to log in to multiple applications using a single authentication process.

36. What is a security token?
A security token is a physical or digital device used for authentication.

37. What is an access control list (ACL)?
An ACL defines rules that allow or deny traffic based on IP, ports, or protocols.

38. What is a container network security concern?
Containers share OS kernels, so misconfigurations can expose services to security threats.

39. What is network segmentation?
It is dividing a network into smaller parts to improve security and performance.

40. What is the difference between active and passive reconnaissance?
Active reconnaissance: Direct interaction with the target.
Passive reconnaissance: Collecting data without direct interaction.
Advanced-Level (41-60) Questions
41. What is mutual TLS (mTLS), and why is it used?
Mutual TLS (mTLS) ensures both client and server authenticate each other before communication, enhancing security in microservices and API interactions.
